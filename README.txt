Digital Textual Analysis with R for Humanists

This project contains materials for the workshop on R for Humanists, originally offered at the University at Buffalo on April 12, 2014.

It contains a couple of datasets, made up of plain text files, plus some R scripts for working with them. The goal of this workshop is to introduce scholars of literature and the humanities to concepts in text analysis, and to walk through some basic procedures using R.  For each example, then, the plan is to demonstrate some relatively simple exercise in stylometry or text analysis, and then to go over the same task step by step as a group.

Apologies to Matt Jockers, from whose published R code (http://matthewjockers.net) we have borrowed several concepts and snippets, and from whom we have also stolen outright his English stoplist.
