
6-1/2 Tuesday Evening.


    My dearest, your note reaches me only now, with an excuse from the
    postman. The answer you expect, you shall have the only way possible.
    I must make up a parcel so as to be able to knock and give it. I shall
    be with you to-morrow, God willing—being quite well.

Bless you ever—
