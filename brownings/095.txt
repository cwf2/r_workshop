
Tuesday Night.
[Post-mark, September 3, 1845.]


    Before you leave London, I will answer your letter—all my attempts
    end in nothing now—

Dearest friend—I am yours ever
R.B.


    But meantime, you will tell me about yourself, will you not? The
    parcel came a few minutes after my note left—Well, I can thank you
    for that; for the Poems,—though I cannot wear them round my
    neck—and for the too great trouble. My heart's friend! Bless you—
