
Tuesday Morning.


    I this minute receive the Review—a poor business, truly! Is there a
    reason for a man's wits dwindling the moment he gets into a critical
    High-place to hold forth?—I have only glanced over the article
    however. Well, one day I am to write of you, dearest, and it must
    come to something rather better than that!


    I am forced to send now what is to be sent at all. Bless you, dearest.
    I am trusting to hear from you—

Your R.B.


    And I find by a note from a fairer friend and favourer of mine that in
    the New Quarterly 'Mr. Browning' figures pleasantly as 'one without
    any sympathy for a human being!'—Then, for newts and efts at all
    events!
