    Well, dearest, at all events I get up with the assurance I shall see
    you, and go on till the fatal 11-1/4 p.m. believing in the same, and
    then, if after all there does come such a note as this with its
    instructions, why, first, it is such a note and such a gain, and
    next it makes a great day out of to-morrow that was to have been so
    little of a day, that is all. Only, only, I am suspicious, now, of a
    real loss to me in the end; for, putting off yesterday, I dared put
    off (on your part) Friday to Saturday ... while now ... what shall
    be said to that?


    Dear Mr. Kenyon to be the smiling inconscious obstacle to any pleasure
    of mine, if it were merely pleasure!


    But I want to catch our next post—to-morrow, then, excepting what is
    to be excepted!

Bless you, my dearest—
Your own
R.B.
