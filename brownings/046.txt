[Post-mark, June 23, 1845.]


    And if I am 'suspicious of your suspiciousness,' who gives cause,
    pray? The matter was long ago settled, I thought, when you first took
    exception to what I said about higher and lower, and I consented to
    this much—that you should help seeing, if you could, our true
    intellectual and moral relation each to the other, so long as you
    would allow me to see what is there, fronting me. 'Is my eye evil
    because yours is not good?' My own friend, if I wished to 'make you
    vain,' if having 'found the Bower' I did really address myself to the
    wise business of spoiling its rose-roof,—I think that at least where
    there was such a will, there would be also something not unlike a
    way,—that I should find a proper hooked stick to tear down flowers
    with, and write you other letters than these—quite, quite others, I
    feel—though I am far from going to imagine, even for a moment, what
    might be the precise prodigy—like the notable Son of Zeus, that was
    to have been, and done the wonders, only he did not, because &c. &c.


    But I have a restless head to-day, and so let you off easily. Well,
    you ask me about it, that head, and I am not justified in being
    positive when my Doctor is dubious; as for the causes, they are
    neither superfluity of study, nor fancy, nor care, nor any special
    naughtiness that I know how to amend. So if I bring you 'nothing to
    signify' on Wednesday ... though I hope to do more than that ... you
    will know exactly why it happens. I will finish and transcribe the
    'Flight of the Duchess' since you spoke of that first.


    I am truly happy to hear that your health improves still.


    For me, going out does me good—reading, writing, and, what is
    odd,—infinitely most of all, sleeping do me the harm,—never any
    very great harm. And all the while I am yours

R.B.
