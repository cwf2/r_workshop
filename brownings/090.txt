
Friday Evening.
[Post-mark, August 30, 1845].


    I do not hear; and come to you to ask the alms of just one line,
    having taken it into my head that something is the matter. It is not
    so much exactingness on my part, as that you spoke of meaning to write
    as soon as you received a note of mine ... which went to you five
    minutes afterwards ... which is three days ago, or will be when you
    read this. Are you not well—or what? Though I have tried and wished
    to remember having written in the last note something very or even a
    little offensive to you, I failed in it and go back to the worse fear.
    For you could not be vexed with me for talking of what was 'your
    fault' ... 'your own fault,' viz. in having to read sentences which,
    but for your commands, would have been blotted out. You could not very
    well take that for serious blame! from me too, who have so much
    reason and provocation for blaming the archangel Gabriel.—No—you
    could not misinterpret so,—and if you could not, and if you are not
    displeased with me, you must be unwell, I think. I took for granted
    yesterday that you had gone out as before—but to-night it is
    different—and so I come to ask you to be kind enough to write one
    word for me by some post to-morrow. Now remember ... I am not asking
    for a letter—but for a word ... or line strictly speaking.

Ever yours, dear friend,
E.B.B.
