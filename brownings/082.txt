
Sunday.
[Post-mark, August 18, 1845.]


    I am going to propose to you to give up Tuesday, and to take your
    choice of two or three other days, say Friday, or Saturday, or
    to-morrow ... Monday. Mr. Kenyon was here to-day and talked of leaving
    London on Friday, and of visiting me again on 'Tuesday' ... he said,
    ... but that is an uncertainty, and it may be Tuesday or Wednesday or
    Thursday. So I thought (wrong or right) that out of the three
    remaining days you would not mind choosing one. And if you do choose
    the Monday, there will be no need to write—nor time indeed—; but if
    the Friday or Saturday, I shall hear from you, perhaps. Above all
    things remember, my dear friend, that I shall not expect you
    to-morrow, except as by a bare possibility. In great haste, signed
    and sealed this Sunday evening by

E.B.B.
