    As for the 'third person,' my sweet Ba, he was a wise speaker from the
    beginning; and in our case he will say, turning to me—'the late
    Robert Hall—when a friend admired that one with so high an estimate
    of the value of intellectuality in woman should yet marry some kind of
    cook-maid animal, as did the said Robert; wisely answered, "you can't
    kiss Mind"! May you not discover eventually,' (this is to me) 'that
    mere intellectual endowments—though incontestably of the loftiest
    character—mere Mind, though that Mind be Miss B's—cannot be
    kissed—nor, repent too late the absence of those humbler qualities,
    those softer affections which, like flowerets at the mountain's foot,
    if not so proudly soaring as, as, as!...' and so on, till one of us
    died, with laughing or being laughed at! So judges the third person!
    and if, to help him, we let him into your room at Wimpole Street,
    suffered him to see with Flush's eyes, he would say with just as wise
    an air 'True, mere personal affections may be warm enough, but does it
    augur well for the durability of an attachment that it should be
    wholly, exclusively based on such perishable attractions as the
    sweetness of a mouth, the beauty of an eye? I could wish, rather, to
    know that there was something of less transitory nature co-existent
    with this—some congeniality of Mental pursuit, some—' Would he not
    say that? But I can't do his platitudes justice because here is our
    post going out and I have been all the morning walking in the perfect
    joy of my heart, with your letter, and under its blessing—dearest,
    dearest Ba—let me say more to-morrow—only this now, that you—ah,
    what are you not to me! My dearest love, bless you—till to-morrow
    when I will strengthen the prayer; (no, lengthen it!)

Ever your own.
