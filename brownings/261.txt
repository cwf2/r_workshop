
Saturday Morning.
[Post-mark, March 7, 1846.]


    You call me 'kind'; and by this time I have no heart to call you such
    names—I told you, did I not once? that 'Ba' had got to convey
    infinitely more of you to my sense than 'dearest,' 'sweetest,' all or
    any epithets that break down with their load of honey like bees—to
    say you are 'kind,' you that so entirely and unintermittingly bless
    me,—it will never do now, 'Ba.' All the same, one way there is to
    make even 'Ba' dearer,—'my Ba,' I say to myself!


    About my fears—whether of opening doors or entering people—one
    thing is observable and prevents the possibility of any
    misconception—I desire, have been in the habit of desiring, to
    increase them, far from diminishing—they relate, of course,
    entirely to you—and only through you affect me the least in the
    world. Put your well-being out of the question, so far as I can
    understand it to be involved,—and the pleasure and pride I should
    immediately choose would be that the whole world knew our position.
    What pleasure, what pride! But I endeavour to remember on all
    occasions—and perhaps succeed in too few—that it is very easy for me
    to go away and leave you who cannot go. I only allude to this because
    some people are 'naturally nervous' and all that—and I am quite of
    another kind.


    Last evening I went out—having been kept at home in the afternoon to
    see somebody ... went walking for hours. I am quite well to-day and,
    now your letter comes, my Ba, most happy. And, as the sun shines, you
    are perhaps making the perilous descent now, while I write—oh, to
    meet you on the stairs! And I shall really see you on Monday, dearest?
    So soon, it ought to feel, considering the dreary weeks that now get
    to go between our days! For music, I made myself melancholy just now
    with some 'Concertos for the Harpsichord by Mr. Handel'—brought home
    by my father the day before yesterday;—what were light, modern things
    once! Now I read not very long ago a French memoir of 'Claude le
    Jeune' called in his time the Prince of Musicians,—no,
    'Phoenix'—the unapproachable wonder to all time—that is, twenty
    years after his death about—and to this pamphlet was prefixed as
    motto this startling axiom—'In Music, the Beau Ideal changes every
    thirty years'—well, is not that true? The Idea, mind,
    changes—the general standard ... so that it is no answer that a
    single air, such as many one knows, may strike as freshly as
    ever—they were not according to the Ideal of their own time—just
    now, they drop into the ready ear,—next hundred years, who will be
    the Rossini? who is no longer the Rossini even I remember—his early
    overtures are as purely Rococo as Cimarosa's or more. The sounds
    remain, keep their character perhaps—the scale's proportioned notes
    affect the same, that is,—the major third, or minor seventh—but the
    arrangement of these, the sequence the law—for them, if it should
    change every thirty years! To Corelli nothing seemed so conclusive in
    Heaven or earth as this

    I don't believe there is one of his sonatas wherein that formula does
    not do duty. In these things of Handel that seems replaced by

—that was the only true consummation! Then,—to go over the hundred
    years,—came Rossini's unanswerable coda:

which serves as base to the infinity of songs, gone, gone—so gone
    by! From all of which Ba draws this 'conclusion' that these may be
    worse things than Bartoli's Tuscan to cover a page with!—yet, yet the
    pity of it! Le Jeune, the Phoenix, and Rossini who directed his
    letters to his mother as 'mother of the famous composer'—and Henry
    Lawes, and Dowland's Lute, ah me!


    Well, my conclusion is the best, the everlasting, here and I trust
    elsewhere—I am your own, my Ba, ever your

R.
