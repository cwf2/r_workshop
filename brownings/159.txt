
Thursday Morning.
[Post-mark, November 27, 1845.]


    How are you? and Miss Bayley's visit yesterday, and Mr. K.'s
    to-day—(He told me he should see you this morning—and I shall pass
    close by, having to be in town and near you,—but only the thought
    will reach you and be with you—) tell me all this, dearest.


    How kind Mr. Kenyon was last night and the day before! He neither
    wonders nor is much vexed, I dare believe—and I write now these few
    words to say so—My heart is set on next Thursday, remember ... and
    the prize of Saturday! Oh, dearest, believe for truth's sake, that I
    would most frankly own to any fault, any imperfection in the beginning
    of my love of you; in the pride and security of this present stage it
    has reached—I would gladly learn, by the full lights now, what an
    insufficient glimmer it grew from, ... but there never has been
    change, only development and increased knowledge and strengthened
    feeling—I was made and meant to look for you and wait for you and
    become yours for ever. God bless you, and make me thankful!


    And you will give me that? What shall save me from wreck: but
    truly? How must I feel to you!

Yours R.B.
