[Post-mark, November 4, 1845.]


    Only a word to tell you Moxon promises the books for to-morrow,
    Wednesday—so towards evening yours will reach you—'parve liber, sine
    me ibis' ... would I were by you, then and ever! You see, and know,
    and understand why I can neither talk to you, nor write to you now,
    as we are now;—from the beginning, the personal interest absorbed
    every other, greater or smaller—but as one cannot well,—or should
    not,—sit quite silently, the words go on, about Horne, or what
    chances—while you are in my thought.


    But when I have you ... so it seems ... in my very heart; when you
    are entirely with me—oh, the day—then it will all go better, talk
    and writing too.


    Love me, my own love; not as I love you—not for—but I cannot write
    that. Nor do I ask anything, with all your gifts here, except for the
    luxury of asking. Withdraw nothing, then, dearest, from your

R.B.
