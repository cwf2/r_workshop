    Ah but the good things do not come together—for just as your letter
    comes I am driven to asking you to leave Tuesday for Wednesday.


    On Tuesday Mr. Kenyon is to be here or not to be here, he
    says—there's a doubt; and you would rather go to a clear day. So if
    you do not hear from me again I shall expect you on Wednesday unless
    I hear to the contrary from you:—and if anything happens to Wednesday
    you shall hear. Mr. Kenyon is in town for only two days, or three. I
    never could grumble against him, so good and kind as he is—but he may
    not come after all to-morrow—so it is not grudging the obolus to
    Belisarius, but the squandering of the last golden days at the bottom
    of the purse.


    Do I 'stand'—Do I walk? Yes—most uprightly. I 'walk upright every
    day.' Do I go out? no, never. And I am not to be scolded for that,
    because when you were looking at the sun to-day, I was marking the
    east wind; and perhaps if I had breathed a breath of it ... farewell
    Pisa. People who can walk don't always walk into the lion's den as a
    consequence—do they? should they? Are you 'sure that they should?' I
    write in great haste. So Wednesday then ... perhaps!

And yours every day.


    You understand. Wednesday—if nothing to the contrary.
