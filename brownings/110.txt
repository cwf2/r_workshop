
Friday Morning.
[Post-mark, September 19, 1845.]


    It is not 'misunderstanding' you to know you to be the most generous
    and loyal of all in the world—you overwhelm me with your
    generosity—only while you see from above and I from below, we cannot
    see the same thing in the same light. Moreover, if we did, I should
    be more beneath you in one sense, than I am. Do me the justice of
    remembering this whenever you recur in thought to the subject which
    ends here in the words of it.


    I began to write last Saturday to thank you for all the delight I had
    had in Shelley, though you beguiled me about the pencil-marks, which
    are few. Besides the translations, some of the original poems were not
    in my copy and were, so, quite new to me. 'Marianne's Dream' I had
    been anxious about to no end—I only know it now.—


    On Monday at the usual hour. As to coming twice into town on Saturday,
    that would have been quite foolish if it had been possible.

Dearest friend,
I am yours,
E.B.B.
