[Post-mark, December 2, 1845.]


    I was happy, so happy before! But I am happier and richer now. My
    love—no words could serve here, but there is life before us, and to
    the end of it the vibration now struck will extend—I will live and
    die with your beautiful ring, your beloved hair—comforting me,
    blessing me.


    Let me write to-morrow—when I think on all you have been and are to
    me, on the wonder of it and the deliciousness, it makes the paper
    words that come seem vainer than ever—To-morrow I will write.


    May God bless you, my own, my precious—

I am all your own
R.B.


    I have thought again, and believe it will be best to select the finger
    you intended ... as the alteration will be simpler, I find; and one
    is less liable to observation and comment.


    Was not that Mr. Kenyon last evening? And did he ask, or hear, or say
    anything?
