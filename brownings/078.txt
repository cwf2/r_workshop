
Tuesday Evening.
[Post-mark, August 13, 1845.]


    What can I say, or hope to say to you when I see what you do for me?


    This—for myself, (nothing for you!)—this, that I think the
    great, great good I get by your kindness strikes me less than that
    kindness.


    All is right, too—


    Come, I will have my fault-finding at last! So you can decypher my
    utterest hieroglyphic? Now droop the eyes while I triumph: the
    plains cower, cower beneath the mountains their masters—and the
    Priests stomp over the clay ridges, (a palpable plagiarism from two
    lines of a legend that delighted my infancy, and now instruct my
    maturer years in pretty nearly all they boast of the semi-mythologic
    era referred to—'In London town, when reigned King Lud, His lords
    went stomping thro' the mud'—would all historic records were half as
    picturesque!)


    But you know, yes, you know you are too indulgent by far—and treat
    these roughnesses as if they were advanced to many a stage! Meantime
    the pure gain is mine, and better, the kind generous spirit is mine,
    (mine to profit by)—and best—best—best, the dearest friend is mine,

So be happy
R.B.
