    It is very kind to send these flowers—too kind—why are they sent?
    and without one single word ... which is not too kind certainly. I
    looked down into the heart of the roses and turned the carnations over
    and over to the peril of their leaves, and in vain! Not a word do I
    deserve to-day, I suppose! And yet if I don't, I don't deserve the
    flowers either. There should have been an equal justice done to my
    demerits, O Zeus with the scales!


    After all I do thank you for these flowers—and they are
    beautiful—and they came just in a right current of time, just when I
    wanted them, or something like them—so I confess that humbly, and
    do thank you, at last, rather as I ought to do. Only you ought not to
    give away all the flowers of your garden to me; and your sister
    thinks so, be sure—if as silently as you sent them. Now I shall not
    write any more, not having been written to. What with the Wednesday's
    flowers and these, you may think how I in this room, look down on the
    gardens of Damascus, let your Jew20 say what he pleases of
    them—and the Wednesday's flowers are as fresh and beautiful, I must
    explain, as the new ones. They were quite supererogatory ... the new
    ones ... in the sense of being flowers. Now, the sense of what I am
    writing seems questionable, does it not?—at least, more so, than the
    nonsense of it.


    Not a word, even under the little blue flowers!!!—
