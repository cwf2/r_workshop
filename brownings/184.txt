[Post-mark, December 27, 1845.]


    I was forced to leave off abruptly on Christmas Morning—and now I
    have but a few minutes before our inexorable post leaves. I hoped to
    return from Town earlier. But I can say something—and Monday will
    make amends.


    'For ever' and for ever I do love you, dearest—love you with my
    whole heart—in life, in death—


    Yes; I did go to Mr. Kenyon's—who had a little to forgive in my slack
    justice to his good dinner, but was for the rest his own kind
    self—and I went, also, to Moxon's—who said something about my
    number's going off 'rather heavily'—so let it!


    Too good, too, too indulgent you are, my own Ba, to 'acts' first or
    last; but all the same, I am glad and encouraged. Let me get done
    with these, and better things will follow.


    Now, bless you, ever, my sweetest—I have you ever in my thoughts—And
    on Monday, remember, I am to see you.

Your own R.B.


    See what I cut out of a Cambridge Advertiser24 of the 24th—to make
    you laugh!
