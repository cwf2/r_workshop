
Wednesday Morning,
[Post-mark, August 27, 1845.]


    On the subject of your letter—quite irrespective of the injunction in
    it—I would not have dared speak; now, at least. But I may permit
    myself, perhaps, to say I am most grateful, most grateful, dearest
    friend, for this admission to participate, in my degree, in these
    feelings. There is a better thing than being happy in your happiness;
    I feel, now that you teach me, it is so. I will write no more now;
    though that sentence of 'what you are expecting,—that I shall be
    tired of you &c.,'—though I could blot that out of your mind for
    ever by a very few words now,—for you would believe me at this
    moment, close on the other subject:—but I will take no such
    advantage—I will wait.


    I have many things (indifferent things, after those) to say; will you
    write, if but a few lines, to change the associations for that
    purpose? Then I will write too.—


    May God bless you,—in what is past and to come! I pray that from my
    heart, being yours

R.B.
