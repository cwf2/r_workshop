    Ever dearest—I will say, as you desire, nothing on that subject—but
    this strictly for myself: you engaged me to consult my own good in the
    keeping or breaking our engagement; not your good as it might even
    seem to me; much less seem to another. My only good in this
    world—that against which all the world goes for nothing—is to spend
    my life with you, and be yours. You know that when I claim anything,
    it is really yourself in me—you give me a right and bid me use it,
    and I, in fact, am most obeying you when I appear most exacting on my
    own account—so, in that feeling, I dare claim, once for all, and in
    all possible cases (except that dreadful one of your becoming worse
    again ... in which case I wait till life ends with both of us), I
    claim your promise's fulfilment—say, at the summer's end: it cannot
    be for your good that this state of things should continue. We can go
    to Italy for a year or two and be happy as day and night are long. For
    me, I adore you. This is all unnecessary, I feel as I write: but you
    will think of the main fact as ordained, granted by God, will you
    not, dearest?—so, not to be put in doubt ever again—then, we can
    go quietly thinking of after matters. Till to-morrow, and ever after,
    God bless my heart's own, own Ba. All my soul follows you,
    love—encircles you—and I live in being yours.
