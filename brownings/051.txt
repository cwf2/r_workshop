
Thursday Evening.
[Post-mark, June 27, 1845.]


    After all it must be for Saturday, as Mrs. Hedley comes again on
    Friday, to-morrow, from New Cross,—or just beyond it, Eltham
    Park—to London for a few days, on account of the illness of one of
    her children. I write in the greatest haste after Miss Mitford has
    left me ... and so tired! to say this, that if you can and will come
    on Saturday, ... or if not on Monday or Tuesday, there is no reason
    against it.

Your friend always,
E.B.B.
