
Friday Morning.
[Post-mark, May 30, 1845.]


    Just one word to say that if Saturday, to-morrow, should be
    fine—because in the case of its raining I shall not expect you; you
    will find me at three o'clock.


    Yes—the circumstances of the costume were mentioned in the letter;
    Mr. Rogers' bag-wig and the rest, and David Wilkie's sword—and also
    that the Laureate, so equipped, fell down upon both knees in the
    superfluity of etiquette, and had to be picked up by two
    lords-in-waiting. It is a large exaggeration I do not doubt—and then
    I never sympathised with the sighing kept up by people about that
    acceptance of the Laureateship which drew the bag-wig as a corollary
    after it. Not that the Laureateship honoured him, but that he
    honoured it; and that, so honouring it, he preserves a symbol
    instructive to the masses, who are children and to be taught by
    symbols now as formerly. Isn't it true? or at least may it not be
    true? And won't the court laurel (such as it is) be all the worthier
    of you for Wordsworth's having worn it first?


    And in the meantime I shall see you to-morrow perhaps? or if it should
    rain, on Monday at the same hour.

Ever yours, my dear friend,
E.B.B.
