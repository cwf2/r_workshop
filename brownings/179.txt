    I do not, nor will not think, dearest, of ever 'making you happy'—I
    can imagine no way of working that end, which does not go straight to
    my own truest, only true happiness—yet in every such effort there is
    implied some distinction, some supererogatory grace, or why speak of
    it at all? You it is, are my happiness, and all that ever can be:
    you—dearest!


    But never, if you would not, what you will not do I know, never revert
    to that frightful wish. 'Disappoint me?' 'I speak what I know and
    testify what I have seen'—you shall 'mystery' again and again—I do
    not dispute that, but do not you dispute, neither, that mysteries
    are. But it is simply because I do most justice to the mystical part
    of what I feel for you, because I consent to lay most stress on that
    fact of facts that I love you, beyond admiration, and respect, and
    esteem and affection even, and do not adduce any reason which stops
    short of accounting for that, whatever else it would account for,
    because I do this, in pure logical justice—you are able to turn and
    wonder (if you do ... now) what causes it all! My love, only wait,
    only believe in me, and it cannot be but I shall, little by little,
    become known to you—after long years, perhaps, but still one day: I
    would say this now—but I will write more to-morrow. God bless my
    sweetest—ever, love, I am your

R.B.


    But my letter came last night, did it not?


    Another thing—no, to-morrow—for time presses, and, in all cases,
    Tuesday—remember!
