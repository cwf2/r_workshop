
Friday Morning.
[Post-mark, June 27, 1845.]


    Let me make haste and write down To-morrow, Saturday, and not later,
    lest my selfishness be thoroughly got under in its struggle with a
    better feeling that tells me you must be far too tired for another
    visitor this week.


    What shall I decide on?


    Well—Saturday is said—but I will stay not quite so long, nor talk
    nearly so loud as of old-times; nor will you, if you understand
    anything of me, fail to send down word should you be at all
    indisposed. I should not have the heart to knock at the door unless I
    really believed you would do that. Still saying this and providing
    against the other does not amount, I well know, to the generosity, or
    justice rather, of staying away for a day or two altogether. But—what
    'a day or two' may not bring forth! Change to you, change to me—


    Not all of me, however, can change, thank God—

Yours ever
R.B.


    Or, write, as last night, if needs be: Monday, Tuesday is not so long
    to wait. Will you write?
