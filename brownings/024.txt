
Tuesday Morning.
[Post-mark, May 13, 1845.]


    Did I thank you with any effect in the lines I sent yesterday, dear
    Miss Barrett? I know I felt most thankful, and, of course, began
    reasoning myself into the impropriety of allowing a 'more' or a 'most'
    in feelings of that sort towards you. I am thankful for you, all about
    you—as, do you not know?


    Thank you, from my soul.


    Now, let me never pass occasion of speaking well of Horne, who
    deserves your opinion of him,—it is my own, too.—He has unmistakable
    genius, and is a fine, honest, enthusiastic chivalrous fellow—it is
    the fashion to affect to sneer at him, of late, I think—the people he
    has praised fancying that they 'pose' themselves sculpturesquely in
    playing the Greatly Indifferent, and the other kind shaking each
    other's hands in hysterical congratulations at having escaped such a
    dishonour: I feel grateful to him, I know, for his generous
    criticism, and glad and proud of in any way approaching such a man's
    standard of poetical height. And he might be a disappointed man
    too,—for the players trifled with and teased out his very nature,
    which has a strange aspiration for the horrible tin-and-lacquer
    'crown' they give one from their clouds (of smooth shaven deal done
    over blue)—and he don't give up the bad business yet, but thinks a
    'small' theatre would somehow not be a theatre, and an actor not quite
    an actor ... I forget in what way, but the upshot is, he bates not a
    jot in that rouged, wigged, padded, empty-headed, heartless tribe of
    grimacers that came and canted me; not I, them;—a thing he cannot
    understand—so, I am not the one he would have picked out to
    praise, had he not been loyal. I know he admires your poetry
    properly. God help him, and send some great artist from the country,
    (who can read and write beside comprehending Shakspeare, and who
    'exasperates his H's' when the feat is to be done)—to undertake the
    part of Cosmo, or Gregory, or what shall most soothe his spirit! The
    subject of your play is tempting indeed—and reminds one of that wild
    Drama of Calderon's which frightened Shelley just before his
    death—also, of Fuseli's theory with reference to his own Picture of
    Macbeth in the witches' cave ... wherein the apparition of the armed
    head from the cauldron is Macbeth's own.


    'If you ask me, I must ask myself'—that is, when I am to see you—I
    will never ask you! You do not know what I shall estimate that
    permission at,—nor do I, quite—but you do—do not you? know so much
    of me as to make my 'asking' worse than a form—I do not 'ask' you to
    write to me—not directly ask, at least.


    I will tell you—I ask you not to see me so long as you are unwell,
    or mistrustful of—


    No, no, that is being too grand! Do see me when you can, and let me
    not be only writing myself

Yours

    A kind, so kind, note from Mr. Kenyon came. We, I and my sister, are
    to go in June instead.... I shall go nowhere till then; I am nearly
    well—all save one little wheel in my head that keeps on its

    That you are better I am most thankful.


    'Next letter' to say how you must help me with all my new Romances and
    Lyrics, and Lays and Plays, and read them and heed them and end them
    and mend them!
