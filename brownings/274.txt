    Indeed, dearest, you shall not have last word as you think,—all the
    'risk' shall not be mine, neither; how can I, in the event, throw
    ambs-ace (is not that the old word?) and not peril your stakes too,
    when once we have common stock and are partners? When I see the
    unicorn and grieve proportionately, do you mean to say you are not
    going to grieve too, for my sake? And if so—why, you clearly run
    exactly the same risk,—must,—unless you mean to rejoice in my
    sorrow! So your chance is my chance; my success your success, you say,
    and my failure, your failure, will you not say? You see, you see, Ba,
    my own—own! What do you think frightened me in your letter for a
    second or two? You write 'Let us talk on Thursday ... Monday I
    forgot'—which I read,—'no, not on Thursday—I had forgotten! It is
    to be Monday when we meet next'!—whereat

     ... as a goose
In death contracts his talons close,

as Hudibras sings—I clutched the letter convulsively—till relief
    came.


    So till to-morrow—my all-beloved! Bless you. I am rather hazy in the
    head as Archer Gurney will find in due season—(he comes, I told
    you)—but all the morning I have been going for once and for ever
    through the 'Tragedy,' and it is done—(done for). Perhaps I may
    bring it to-morrow—if my sister can copy all; I cut out a huge kind
    of sermon from the middle and reserve it for a better time—still it
    is very long; so long! So, if I ask, may I have 'Luria' back to
    morrow? So shall printing begin, and headache end—and 'no more for
    the present from your loving'

R.B.
