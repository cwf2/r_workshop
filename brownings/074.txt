
Friday Afternoon.
[Post-mark, August 8, 1845.]


    Then there is one more thing 'off my mind': I thought it might be with
    you as with me—not remembering how different are the causes that
    operate against us; different in kind as in degree:—so much reading
    hurts me, for instance,—whether the reading be light or heavy,
    fiction or fact, and so much writing, whether my own, such as you
    have seen, or the merest compliment-returning to the weary tribe that
    exact it of one. But your health—that before all!... as assuring all
    eventually ... and on the other accounts you must know! Never, pray,
    pray, never lose one sunny day or propitious hour to 'go out or walk
    about.' But do not surprise me, one of these mornings, by 'walking'
    up to me when I am introduced' ... or I shall infallibly, in spite of
    all the after repentance and begging pardon—I shall [words effaced].
    So here you learn the first 'painful truth' I have it in my power to
    tell you!


    I sent you the last of our poor roses this morning—considering that I
    fairly owed that kindness to them.


    Yes, I went to Chelsea and found dear Carlyle alone—his wife is in
    the country where he will join her as soon as his book's last sheet
    returns corrected and fit for press—which will be at the month's end
    about. He was all kindness and talked like his own self while he made
    me tea—and, afterward, brought chairs into the little yard, rather
    than garden, and smoked his pipe with apparent relish; at night he
    would walk as far as Vauxhall Bridge on my way home.


    If I used the word 'sacrifice,' you do well to object—I can imagine
    nothing ever to be done by me worthy such a name.


    God bless you, dearest friend—shall I hear from you before Tuesday?

Ever your own
R.B.
