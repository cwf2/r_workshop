
Monday Morning.
[Post-mark, October 6, 1845.]


    I should certainly think that the Duke of Palmella may be induced, and
    with no great difficulty, to give up a cabin under the
    circumstances—and then the plan becomes really objection-proof, so
    far as mortal plans go. But now you must think all the boldlier about
    whatever difficulties remain, just because they are so much the fewer.
    It is cold already in the mornings and evenings—cold and (this
    morning) foggy—I did not ask if you continue to go out from time to
    time.... I am sure you should,—you would so prepare yourself
    properly for the fatigue and change—yesterday it was very warm and
    fine in the afternoon, nor is this noontime so bad, if the requisite
    precautions are taken. And do make 'journeys across the room,' and out
    of it, meanwhile, and stand when possible—get all the strength
    ready, now that so much is to be spent. Oh, if I were by you!


    Thank you, thank you—I will devise titles—I quite see what you say,
    now you do say it. I am (this Monday morning, the prescribed day for
    efforts and beginnings) looking over and correcting what you read—to
    press they shall go, and then the plays can follow gently, and then
    ... 'Oh to be in Pisa. Now that E.B.B. is there!'—And I shall be
    there!... I am much better to-day; and my mother better—and to-morrow
    I shall see you—So come good things together!


    Dearest—till to-morrow and ever I am yours, wholly yours—May God
    bless you!

R.B.


    You do not ask me that 'boon'—why is that?—Besides, I have my own
    real boons to ask too, as you will inevitably find, and I shall
    perhaps get heart by your example.
