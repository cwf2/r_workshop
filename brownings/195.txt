
Friday Morning.


    As if I could deny you anything! Here is the Review—indeed it was
    foolish to mind your seeing it at all. But now, may I stipulate?—You
    shall not send it back—but on your table I shall find and take it
    next Tuesday—c'est convenu! The other precious volume has not yet
    come to hand (nor to foot) all through your being so sure that to
    carry it home would have been the death of me last evening!


    I cannot write my feelings in this large writing, begun on such a
    scale for the Review's sake; and just now—there is no denying it, and
    spite of all I have been incredulous about—it does seem that the fact
    is achieved and that I do love you, plainly, surely, more than
    ever, more than any day in my life before. It is your secret, the why,
    the how; the experience is mine. What are you doing to me?—in the
    heart's heart.


    Rest—dearest—bless you—
