[Post-mark, May 12, 1845.]


    My dear, own friend, I am quite well now, or next to it—but this is
    how it was,—I have gone out a great deal of late, and my head took to
    ringing such a literal alarum that I wondered what was to come of it;
    and at last, a few evenings ago, as I was dressing for a dinner
    somewhere, I got really bad of a sudden, and kept at home to my
    friend's heartrending disappointment. Next morning I was no
    better—and it struck me that I should be really disappointing dear
    kind Mr. Kenyon, and wasting his time, if that engagement, too, were
    broken with as little warning,—so I thought it best to forego all
    hopes of seeing him, at such a risk. And that done, I got rid of every
    other promise to pay visits for next week and next, and told
    everybody, with considerable dignity, that my London season was over
    for this year, as it assuredly is—and I shall be worried no more, and
    let walk in the garden, and go to bed at ten o'clock, and get done
    with what is most expedient to do, and my 'flesh shall come again like
    a little child's,' and one day, oh the day, I shall see you with my
    own, own eyes ... for, how little you understand me; or rather,
    yourself,—if you think I would dare see you, without your leave, that
    way! Do you suppose that your power of giving and refusing ends when
    you have shut your room-door? Did I not tell you I turned down another
    street, even, the other day, and why not down yours? And often as I
    see Mr. Kenyon, have I ever dreamed of asking any but the merest
    conventional questions about you; your health, and no more?


    I will answer your letter, the last one, to-morrow—I have said
    nothing of what I want to say.

Ever yours
R.B.
