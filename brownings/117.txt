    Then first, ... first, I ask you not to misunderstand. Because we do
    not ... no, we do not ... agree (but disagree) as to 'what is your
    true good' ... but disagree, and as widely as ever indeed.


    The other asking shall come in its season ... some day before I go, if
    I go. It only relates to a restitution—and you cannot guess it if you
    try ... so don't try!—and perhaps you can't grant it if you try—and
    I cannot guess.


    Cabins and berths all taken in the Malta steamer for both third and
    twentieth of October! see what dark lanterns the stars hold out, and
    how I shall stay in England after all as I think! And thus we are
    thrown back on the old Gibraltar scheme with its shifting of steamers
    ... unless we take the dreary alternative of Madeira!—or Cadiz! Even
    suppose Madeira, ... why it were for a few months alone—and there
    would be no temptation to loiter as in Italy.


    Don't think too hardly of poor Papa. You have his wrong side ... his
    side of peculiar wrongness ... to you just now. When you have walked
    round him you will have other thoughts of him.


    Are you better, I wonder? and taking exercise and trying to be better?
    May God bless you! Tuesday need not be the last day if you like to
    take one more besides—for there is no going until the fourth or
    seventh, ... and the seventh is the more probable of those two. But
    now you have done with me until Tuesday.

Ever yours,
E.B.B.
