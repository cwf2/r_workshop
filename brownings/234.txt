[Post-mark, February 16, 1846.]


    My long letter is with you, dearest, to show how serious my illness
    was 'while you wrote': unless you find that letter too foolish, as I
    do on twice thinking—or at all events a most superfluous bestowment
    of handwork while the heart was elsewhere, and with you—never more
    so! Dear, dear Ba, your adorable goodness sinks into me till it nearly
    pains,—so exquisite and strange is the pleasure: so you care for
    me, and think of me, and write to me!—I shall never die for you, and
    if it could be so, what would death prove? But I can live on, your own
    as now,—utterly your own.


    Dear Ba, do you suppose we differ on so plain a point as that of the
    superior wisdom, and generosity, too, of announcing such a change &c.
    at the eleventh hour? There can be no doubt of it,—and now, what of
    it to me?


    But I am not going to write to-day—only this—that I am better,
    having not been quite so well last night—so I shut up books (that is,
    of my own) and mean to think about nothing but you, and you, and still
    you, for a whole week—so all will come right, I hope! May I take
    Wednesday? And do you say that,—hint at the possibility of that,
    because you have been reached by my own remorse at feeling that if I
    had kept my appointment last Saturday (but one)—Thursday would have
    been my day this past week, and this very Monday had been gained?
    Shall I not lose a day for ever unless I get Wednesday and
    Saturday?—yet ... care ... dearest—let nothing horrible happen.


    If I do not hear to the contrary to-morrow—or on Wednesday early—


    But write and bless me dearest, most dear Ba. God bless you ever—
