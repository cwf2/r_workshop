
Saturday Morning.
[Post-mark, June 7, 1845.]


    I ventured to hope this morning might bring me news of you—First
    East-winds on you, then myself, then those criticisms!—I do assure
    you I am properly apprehensive. How are you? May I go on Wednesday
    without too much ανθαδια.


    Pray remember what I said and wrote, to the effect that my exceptions
    were, in almost every case, to the 'reading'—not to your version of
    it: but I have not specified the particular ones—not written down the
    Greek, of my suggested translations—have I? And if you do not find
    them in the margin of your copy, how you must wonder! Thus, in the
    last speech but one, of Hermes, I prefer Porson and Blomfield's
    ει μηδ' ατυχων τι χαλα μανιων;—to the old combinations
    that include ευτυχη—though there is no MS. authority for
    emendation, it seems. But in what respect does Prometheus 'fare
    well,' or 'better' even, since the beginning? And is it not the old
    argument over again, that when a man fails he should repent of his
    ways?—And while thinking of Hermes, let me say that 'μηδε μοι διπλας οδους προσβαλης' is surely—'Don't subject me to the trouble
    of a second journey ... by paying no attention to the first.' So says
    Scholiast A, and so backs him Scholiast B, especially created, it
    should appear, to show there could be in rerum naturâ such another
    as his predecessor. A few other remarks occur to me, which I will tell
    you if you please; now, I really want to know how you are, and write
    for that.

Ever yours,
R.B.
