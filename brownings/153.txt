
Thursday Morning.


    Here is the copy of Landor's verses.


    You know thoroughly, do you not, why I brought all those good-natured
    letters, desperate praise and all? Not, not out of the least vanity
    in the world—nor to help myself in your sight with such testimony:
    would it seem very extravagant, on the contrary, if I said that
    perhaps I laid them before your eyes in a real fit of compunction at
    not being, in my heart, thankful enough for the evident motive of the
    writers,—and so was determined to give them the 'last honours' if
    not the first, and not make them miss you because, through my fault,
    they had missed me? Does this sound too fantastical? Because it is
    strictly true: the most laudatory of all, I skimmed once over with
    my flesh creeping—it seemed such a death-struggle, that of good
    nature over—well, it is fresh ingratitude of me, so here it shall
    end.


    I am not ungrateful to you—but you must wait to know that:—I can
    speak less than nothing with my living lips.


    I mean to ask your brother how you are to-night ... so quietly!


    God bless you, my dearest, and reward you.

Your R.B.


    Mrs. Shelley—with the 'Ricordi.'


    Of course, Landor's praise is altogether a different gift; a gold vase
    from King Hiram; beside he has plenty of conscious rejoicing in his
    own riches, and is not left painfully poor by what he sends away.
    That is the unpleasant point with some others—they spread you a
    board and want to gird up their loins and wait on you there. Landor
    says 'come up higher and let us sit and eat together.' Is it not that?


    Now—you are not to turn on me because the first is my proper feeling
    to you, ... for poetry is not the thing given or taken between
    us—it is heart and life and myself, not mine, I give—give? That
    you glorify and change and, in returning then, give me!
