[Post-mark, August 19, 1845.]


    I this moment get your note—having been out since the early
    morning—and I must write just to catch the post. You are pure
    kindness and considerateness, no thanks to you!—(since you will
    have it so—). I choose Friday, then,—but I shall hear from you
    before Thursday, I dare hope? I have all but passed your house
    to-day—with an Italian friend, from Rome, whom I must go about with a
    little on weariful sight seeing, so I shall earn Friday.

Bless you
R.B.
