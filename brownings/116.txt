    Think for me, speak for me, my dearest, my own! You that are all
    great-heartedness and generosity, do that one more generous thing?

God bless you for
R.B.


    What can it be you ask of me!—'a boon'—once my answer to that had
    been the plain one—but now ... when I have better experience of—No,
    now I have best experience of how you understand my interests; that at
    last we both know what is my true good—so ask, ask! My own, now!
    For there it is!—oh, do not fear I am 'entangled'—my crown is
    loose on my head, not nailed there—my pearl lies in my hand—I may
    return it to the sea, if I will!


    What is it you ask of me, this first asking?
