    And now, my heart's love, I am waiting to hear from you; my heart is
    full of you. When I try to remember what I said yesterday, that
    thought, of what fills my heart—only that makes me bear with the
    memory.... I know that even such imperfect, poorest of words must
    have come from thence if not bearing up to you all that is
    there—and I know you are ever above me to receive, and help, and
    forgive, and wait for the one day which I will never say to myself
    cannot come, when I shall speak what I feel—more of it—or some of
    it—for now nothing is spoken.


    My all-beloved—


    Ah, you opposed very rightly, I dare say, the writing that paper I
    spoke of! The process should be so much simpler! I most earnestly
    expect of you, my love, that in the event of any such necessity as
    was then alluded to, you accept at once in my name any conditions
    possible for a human will to submit to—there is no imaginable
    condition to which you allow me to accede that I will not joyfully
    bend all my faculties to comply with. And you know this—but so, also
    do you know more ... and yet 'I may tire of you'—'may forget you'!


    I will write again, having the long, long week to wait! And one of the
    things I must say, will be, that with my love, I cannot lose my pride
    in you—that nothing but that love could balance that pride—and
    that, blessing the love so divinely, you must minister to the pride as
    well; yes, my own—I shall follow your fame,—and, better than fame,
    the good you do—in the world—and, if you please, it shall all be
    mine—as your hand, as your eyes—


    I will write and pray it from you into a promise ... and your promises
    I live upon.


    May God bless you! your R.B.
