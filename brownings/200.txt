[Post-mark, January 14, 1846.]


    Was I in the wrong, dearest, to go away with Mr. Kenyon? I well knew
    and felt the price I was about to pay—but the thought did occur
    that he might have been informed my probable time of departure was
    that of his own arrival—and that he would not know how very soon,
    alas, I should be obliged to go—so ... to save you any least
    embarrassment in the world, I got—just that shake of the hand, just
    that look—and no more! And was it all for nothing, all needless after
    all? So I said to myself all the way home.


    When I am away from you—a crowd of things press on me for
    utterance—'I will say them, not write them,' I think:—when I see
    you—all to be said seems insignificant, irrelevant,—'they can be
    written, at all events'—I think that too. So, feeling so much, I
    say so little!


    I have just returned from Town and write for the Post—but you mean
    to write, I trust.


    That was not obtained, that promise, to be happy with, as last time!


    How are you?—tell me, dearest; a long week is to be waited now!

Bless you, my own, sweetest Ba.
I am wholly your
R.
