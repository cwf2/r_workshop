[Post-mark, July 31, 1845.]


    In all I say to you, write to you, I know very well that I trust to
    your understanding me almost beyond the warrant of any human
    capacity—but as I began, so I shall end. I shall believe you remember
    what I am forced to remember—you who do me the superabundant justice
    on every possible occasion,—you will never do me injustice when I sit
    by you and talk about Italy and the rest.


    —To-day I cannot write—though I am very well otherwise—but I shall
    soon get into my old self-command and write with as much 'ineffectual
    fire' as before: but meantime, you will write to me, I hope—telling
    me how you are? I have but one greater delight in the world than in
    hearing from you.


    God bless you, my best, dearest friend—think what I would speak—

Ever yours
R.B.
