
Saturday Morning.
[Post-mark, February 7, 1846.]


    Dearest, to my sorrow I must, I fear, give up the delight of seeing
    you this morning. I went out unwell yesterday, and a long noisy dinner
    with speech-making, with a long tiresome walk at the end of it—these
    have given me such a bewildering headache that I really see some
    reason in what they say here about keeping the house. Will you forgive
    me—and let me forget it all on Monday? On Monday—unless I am told
    otherwise by the early post—And God bless you ever

Your own—
