
Wednesday.
[Post-mark, September 18, 1845.]


    Of course you cannot do otherwise than go with your sister—or it will
    be 'Every man out of his humour' perhaps—and you are not so very
    'savage' after all.


    On Monday then, if you do not hear—to the contrary.


    Papa has been walking to and fro in this room, looking thoughtfully
    and talking leisurely—and every moment I have expected I confess,
    some word (that did not come) about Pisa. Mr. Kenyon thinks it cannot
    end so—and I do sometimes—and in the meantime I do confess to a
    little 'savageness' also—at heart! All I asked him to say the other
    day, was that he was not displeased with me—and he wouldn't; and
    for me to walk across his displeasure spread on the threshold of the
    door, and moreover take a sister and brother with me, and do such a
    thing for the sake of going to Italy and securing a personal
    advantage, were altogether impossible, obviously impossible! So poor
    Papa is quite in disgrace with me just now—if he would but care for
    that!


    May God bless you. Amuse yourself well on Saturday. I could not see
    you on Thursday any way, for Mr. Kenyon is here every day ... staying
    in town just on account of this Pisa business, in his abundant
    kindness.... On Monday then.

Ever yours,
E.B.B.
