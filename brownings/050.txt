
12. Wednesday.
[Post-mark, June 25, 1845.]


    Pomegranates you may cut deep down the middle and see into, but not
    hearts,—so why should I try and speak?


    Friday is best day because nearest, but Saturday is next best—it is
    next near, you know: if I get no note, therefore, Friday is my day.


    Now is Post-time,—which happens properly.


    God bless you, and so your own

R.B.
