
Tuesday Morning,
[Post-mark, June 24, 1845.]


    (So my friend did not in the spirit see me write that first letter,
    on Friday, which was too good and true to send, and met, five minutes
    after, its natural fate accordingly. Then on Saturday I thought to
    take health by storm, and walked myself half dead all the
    morning—about town too: last post-hour from this Thule of a
    suburb—4 P.M. on Saturdays, next expedition of letters, 8 A.M. on
    Mondays;—and then my real letter set out with the others—and, it
    should seem, set at rest a 'wonder whether thy friend's questions
    deserved answering'—de-served—answer-ing—!)


    Parenthetically so much—I want most, though, to tell you—(leaving
    out any slightest attempt at thanking you) that I am much better,
    quite well to-day—that my doctor has piloted me safely through two or
    three illnesses, and knows all about me, I do think—and that he talks
    confidently of getting rid of all the symptoms complained of—and
    has made a good beginning if I may judge by to-day. As for going
    abroad, that is just the thing I most want to avoid (for a reason not
    so hard to guess, perhaps, as why my letter was slow in arriving).


    So, till to-morrow,—my light through the dark week.

God ever bless you, dear friend,
R.B.
