[Post-mark, August 20, 1845.]


    Mauvaise, mauvaise, mauvaise, you know as I know, just as much, that
    your 'kindness and considerateness' consisted, not in putting off
    Tuesday for another day, but in caring for my coming at all; for my
    coming and being told at the door that you were engaged, and I might
    call another time! And you are not, not my 'other friend,' any more
    than this head of mine is my other head, seeing that I have got a
    violin which has a head too! All which, beware lest you get fully told
    in the letter I will write this evening, when I have done with my
    Romans—who are, it so happens, here at this minute; that is, have
    left the house for a few minutes with my sister—but are not 'with
    me,' as you seem to understand it,—in the house to stay. They were
    kind to me in Rome, (husband and wife), and I am bound to be of what
    use I may during their short stay. Let me lose no time in begging and
    praying you to cry 'hands off' to that dreadful Burgess; have not I
    got a ... but I will tell you to-night—or on Friday which is my day,
    please—Friday. Till when, pray believe me, with respect and esteem,


    Your most obliged and disobliged at these blank endings—what have I
    done? God bless you ever dearest friend.
