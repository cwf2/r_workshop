    Saturday, Monday, as you shall appoint—no need to say that, or my
    thanks—but this note troubles you, out of my bounden duty to help
    you, or Miss Mitford, to make the Painter run violently down a steep
    place into the sea, if that will amuse you, by further informing him,
    what I know on the best authority, that Wordsworth's 'bag-wig,' or at
    least, the more important of his court-habiliments, were considerately
    furnished for the nonce by Mr. Rogers from his own wardrobe, to the
    manifest advantage of the Laureate's pocket, but more problematic
    improvement of his person, when one thinks on the astounding
    difference of 'build' in the two Poets:—the fact should be put on
    record, if only as serving to render less chimerical a promise
    sometimes figuring in the columns of provincial newspapers—that the
    two apprentices, some grocer or other advertises for, will be 'boarded
    and clothed like one of the family.' May not your unfinished
    (really good) head of the great man have been happily kept waiting for
    the body which can now be added on, with all this picturesqueness of
    circumstances. Precept on precept ... but then, line upon line, is
    allowed by as good authority, and may I not draw my confirming black
    line after yours, yet not break pledge? I am most grateful to you for
    doing me justice—doing yourself, your own judgment, justice, since
    even the play-wright of Theseus and the Amazon found it one of his
    hardest devices to 'write me a speech, lest the lady be frightened,
    wherein it shall be said that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but &c. &c.'
    God bless you—one thing more, but one—you could never have
    misunderstood the asking for the letter again, I feared you might
    refer to it 'pour constater le fait'—

And now I am yours—
R.B.


    My head is all but well now; thank you.
