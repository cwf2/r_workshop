    Words!—it was written I should hate and never use them to any
    purpose. I will not say one word here—very well knowing neither word
    nor deed avails—from me.


    My letter will have reassured you on the point you seem undecided
    about—whether I would speak &c.


    I will come whenever you shall signify that I may ... whenever, acting
    in my best interests, you feel that it will not hurt you (weary you in
    any way) to see me—but I fear that on Saturday I must be
    otherwhere—I enclose the letter from my old foe. Which could not but
    melt me for all my moroseness and I can hardly go and return for my
    sister in time. Will you tell me?


    It is dark—but I want to save the post—

Ever yours
R.B.
