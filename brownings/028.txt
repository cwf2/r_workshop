
Tuesday Evening.
[Post-mark, May 21, 1845.]


    I trust to you for a true account of how you are—if tired, if not
    tired, if I did wrong in any thing,—or, if you please, right in any
    thing—(only, not one more word about my 'kindness,' which, to get
    done with, I will grant is exceptive)—but, let us so arrange matters
    if possible,—and why should it not be—that my great happiness, such
    as it will be if I see you, as this morning, from time to time, may be
    obtained at the cost of as little inconvenience to you as we can
    contrive. For an instance—just what strikes me—they all say here I
    speak very loud—(a trick caught from having often to talk with a deaf
    relative of mine). And did I stay too long?


    I will tell you unhesitatingly of such 'corrigenda'—nay, I will
    again say, do not humiliate me—do not again,—by calling me 'kind'
    in that way.


    I am proud and happy in your friendship—now and ever. May God bless
    you!

R.B.
