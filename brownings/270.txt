    Indeed I would, dearest Ba, go with entire gladness and pride to see a
    light that came from your room—why should that surprise you? Well,
    you will know one day.


    We understand each other too about the sofas and gilding—oh, I know
    you, my own sweetest! For me, if I had set those matters to heart, I
    should have turned into the obvious way of getting them—not out of
    it, as I did resolutely from the beginning. All I meant was, to
    express a very natural feeling—if one could give you diamonds for
    flowers, and if you liked diamonds,—then, indeed! As it is, wherever
    we are found shall be, if you please, 'For the love's sake found
    therein—sweetest house was ever seen!'


    Mr. Kenyon must be merciful. Lilies are of all colours in
    Palestine—one sort is particularized as white with a dark blue spot
    and streak—the water lily, lotos, which I think I meant, is blue
    altogether.


    I have walked this morning to town and back—I feel much better,
    'honestly'! The head better—the spirits rising—as how should they
    not, when you think all will go well in the end, when you write to
    me that you go down-stairs and are stronger—and when the rest is
    written?


    Not more now, dearest, for time is pressing, but you will answer
    this,—the love that is not here,—not the idle words, and I will
    reply to-morrow. Thursday is so far away yet!


    Bless you, my very own, only dearest!
