    The clock strikes—three; and I am here, not with you—and my
    'fractious' headache at the very worst got suddenly better just now,
    and is leaving me every minute—as if to make me aware, with an
    undivided attention, that at this present you are waiting for me, and
    soon will be wondering—and it would be so easy now to dress myself
    and walk or run or ride—do anything that led to you ... but by no
    haste in the world could I reach you, I am forced to see, before a
    quarter to five—by which time I think my letter must arrive. Dear,
    dearest Ba, did you but know how vexed I am—with myself, with—this
    is absurd, of course. The cause of it all was my going out last
    night—yet that, neither, was to be helped, the party having been
    twice put off before—once solely on my account. And the sun shines,
    and you would shine—


    Monday is to make all the amends in its power, is it not? Still, still
    I have lost my day.

Bless you, my ever-dearest.
Your R.
