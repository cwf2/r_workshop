[Post-mark, October 18, 1845.]


    I must not go on tearing these poor sheets one after the other,—the
    proper phrases will not come,—so let them stay, while you care for
    my best interests in their best, only way, and say for me what I
    would say if I could—dearest,—say it, as I feel it!


    I am thankful to hear of the continued improvement of your brother. So
    may it continue with him! Pulses I know very little about—I go by
    your own impressions which are evidently favourable.


    I will make a note as you suggest—or, perhaps, keep it for the
    closing number (the next), when it will come fitly in with two or
    three parting words I shall have to say. The Rabbis make Bells and
    Pomegranates symbolical of Pleasure and Profit, the gay and the grave,
    the Poetry and the Prose, Singing and Sermonizing—such a mixture of
    effects as in the original hour (that is quarter of an hour) of
    confidence and creation. I meant the whole should prove at last. Well,
    it has succeeded beyond my most adventurous wishes in one
    respect—'Blessed eyes mine eyes have been, if—' if there was any
    sweetness in the tongue or flavour in the seeds to her. But I shall
    do quite other and better things, or shame on me! The proof has not
    yet come.... I should go, I suppose, and enquire this afternoon—and
    probably I will.


    I weigh all the words in your permission to come on Monday ... do not
    think I have not seen that contingency from the first! Let it be
    Tuesday—no sooner! Meanwhile you are never away—never from your
    place here.

God bless my dearest.
Ever yours
R.B.
