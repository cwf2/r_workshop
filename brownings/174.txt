
Monday Morning.
[Post-mark, December 15, 1845.]


    Every word you write goes to my heart and lives there: let us live so,
    and die so, if God will. I trust many years hence to begin telling you
    what I feel now;—that the beam of the light will have reached
    you!—meantime it is here. Let me kiss your forehead, my sweetest,
    dearest.


    Wednesday I am waiting for—how waiting for!


    After all, it seems probable that there was no intentional mischief in
    that jeweller's management of the ring. The divided gold must have
    been exposed to fire—heated thoroughly, perhaps,—and what became of
    the contents then! Well, all is safe now, and I go to work again of
    course. My next act is just done—that is, being done—but, what I
    did not foresee, I cannot bring it, copied, by Wednesday, as my sister
    went this morning on a visit for the week.


    On the matters, the others, I will not think, as you bid me,—if I can
    help, at least. But your kind, gentle, good sisters! and the provoking
    sorrow of the right meaning at bottom of the wrong doing—wrong to
    itself and its plain purpose—and meanwhile, the real tragedy and
    sacrifice of a life!


    If you should see Mr. Kenyon, and can find if he will be disengaged on
    Wednesday evening, I shall be glad to go in that case.


    But I have been writing, as I say, and will leave off this, for the
    better communing with you. Don't imagine I am unwell; I feel quite
    well, but a little tired, and the thought of you waits in such
    readiness! So, may God bless you, beloved!

I am all your own
R.B.
