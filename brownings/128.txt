
Tuesday Morning,
[Post-mark, October 14, 1845.]


    Be sure, my own, dearest love, that this is for the best; will be seen
    for the best in the end. It is hard to bear now—but you have to
    bear it; any other person could not, and you will, I know, knowing
    you—will be well this one winter if you can, and then—since I am
    not selfish in this love to you, my own conscience tells me,—I
    desire, more earnestly than I ever knew what desiring was, to be yours
    and with you and, as far as may be in this life and world, you—and
    no hindrance to that, but one, gives me a moment's care or fear; but
    that one is just your little hand, as I could fancy it raised in any
    least interest of yours—and before that, I am, and would ever be,
    still silent. But now—what is to make you raise that hand? I will not
    speak now; not seem to take advantage of your present feelings,—we
    will be rational, and all-considering and weighing consequences, and
    foreseeing them—but first I will prove ... if that has to be done,
    why—but I begin speaking, and I should not, I know.

Bless you, love!
R.B.


    To-morrow I see you, without fail. I am rejoiced as you can imagine,
    at your brother's improved state.
