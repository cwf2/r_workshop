

    Just arrived!—(mind, the silent writing overflows the page, and
    laughs at the black words for Mr. Kenyon to read!)—But your note
    arrived earlier—more of that, when I write after this dreadful
    dispatching-business that falls on me—friend A. and B. and C. must
    get their copy, and word of regard, all by next post!—


    Could you think that that untoward letter lived one moment after
    it returned to me? I burned it and cried 'serve it right'! Poor
    letter,—yet I should have been vexed and offended then to be told I
    could love you better than I did already. 'Live and learn!' Live
    and love you—dearest, as loves you

    You will write to reassure me about Saturday, if not for other
    reasons. See your corrections ... and understand that in one or two
    instances in which they would seem not to be adopted, they are so,
    by some modification of the previous, or following line ... as in one
    of the Sorrento lines ... about a 'turret'—see! (Can you give me
    Horne's address—I would send then.)
