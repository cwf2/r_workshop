
Sunday—in the last hour of it.
[Post-mark, May 12, 1845.]


    May I ask how the head is? just under the bag? Mr. Kenyon was here
    to-day and told me such bad news that I cannot sleep to-night
    (although I did think once of doing it) without asking such a question
    as this, dear Mr. Browning.


    Let me hear how you are—Will you? and let me hear (if I can) that it
    was prudence or some unchristian virtue of the sort, and not a dreary
    necessity, which made you put aside the engagement for Tuesday—for
    Monday. I had been thinking so of seeing you on Tuesday ... with my
    sister's eyes—for the first sight.


    And now if you have done killing the mules and the dogs, let me have
    a straight quick arrow for myself, if you please. Just a word, to say
    how you are. I ask for no more than a word, lest the writing should be
    hurtful to you.

May God bless you always.
Your friend,
E.B.B.
