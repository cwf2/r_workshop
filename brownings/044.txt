
Thursday Morning.
[Post-mark, June 19, 1845.]


    When I next see you, do not let me go on and on to my confusion about
    matters I am more or less ignorant of, but always ignorant. I tell
    you plainly I only trench on them, and intrench in them, from
    gaucherie, pure and respectable ... I should certainly grow
    instructive on the prospects of hay-crops and pasture-land, if
    deprived of this resource. And now here is a week to wait before I
    shall have any occasion to relapse into Greek literature when I am
    thinking all the while, 'now I will just ask simply, what flattery
    there was,' &c. &c., which, as I had not courage to say then, I keep
    to myself for shame now. This I will say, then—wait and know me
    better, as you will one long day at the end.


    Why I write now, is because you did not promise, as before, to let me
    know how you are—this morning is miserably cold again—Will you tell
    me, at your own time?


    God bless you, my dear friend.

R.B.
