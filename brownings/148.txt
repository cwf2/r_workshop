
Sunday Evening.
[Post-mark, November 10, 1845.]


    When I come back from seeing you, and think over it all, there never
    is a least word of yours I could not occupy myself with, and wish to
    return to you with some ... not to say, all ... the thoughts and
    fancies it is sure to call out of me. There is nothing in you that
    does not draw out all of me. You possess me, dearest ... and there is
    no help for the expressing it all, no voice nor hand, but these of
    mine which shrink and turn away from the attempt. So you must go on,
    patiently, knowing me more and more, and your entire power on me, and
    I will console myself, to the full extent, with your
    knowledge—penetration, intuition—somehow I must believe you can
    get to what is here, in me, without the pretence of my telling or
    writing it. But, because I give up the great achievements, there is no
    reason I should not secure any occasion of making clear one of the
    less important points that arise in our intercourse ... if I fancy I
    can do it with the least success. For instance, it is on my mind to
    explain what I meant yesterday by trusting that the entire happiness I
    feel in the letters, and the help in the criticising might not be hurt
    by the surmise, even, that those labours to which you were born, might
    be suspended, in any degree, through such generosity to me. Dearest,
    I believed in your glorious genius and knew it for a true star from
    the moment I saw it; long before I had the blessing of knowing it was
    my star, with my fortune and futurity in it. And, when I draw back
    from myself, and look better and more clearly, then I do feel, with
    you, that the writing a few letters more or less, reading many or few
    rhymes of any other person, would not interfere in any material degree
    with that power of yours—that you might easily make one so happy and
    yet go on writing 'Geraldines' and 'Berthas'—but—how can I, dearest,
    leave my heart's treasures long, even to look at your genius?... and
    when I come back and find all safe, find the comfort of you, the
    traces of you ... will it do—tell me—to trust all that as a light
    effort, an easy matter?


    Yet, if you can lift me with one hand, while the other suffices to
    crown you—there is queenliness in that, too!


    Well, I have spoken. As I told you, your turn comes now. How have you
    determined respecting the American Edition? You tell me nothing of
    yourself! It is all me you help, me you do good to ... and I take it
    all! Now see, if this goes on! I have not had every love-luxury, I
    now find out ... where is the proper, rationally
    to-be-expected—'lovers' quarrel'? Here, as you will find! 'Iræ;
    amantium'.... I am no more 'at a loss with my Naso,' than Peter
    Ronsard. Ah, but then they are to be reintegratio amoris—and to get
    back into a thing, one must needs get for a moment first out of it ...
    trust me, no! And now, the natural inference from all this? The
    consistent inference ... the 'self-denying ordinance'? Why—do you
    doubt? even this,—you must just put aside the Romance, and tell the
    Americans to wait, and make my heart start up when the letter is laid
    to it; the letter full of your news, telling me you are well and
    walking, and working for my sake towards the time—informing me,
    moreover, if Thursday or Friday is to be my day—.


    May God bless you, my own love.


    I will certainly bring you an Act of the Play ... for this serpent's
    reason, in addition to the others ... that—No, I will tell you
    that—I can tell you now more than even lately!

Ever your own
R.B.
