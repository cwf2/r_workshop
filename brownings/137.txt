    'And be forgiven' ... yes! and be thanked besides—if I knew how to
    thank you worthily and as I feel ... only that I do not know it, and
    cannot say it. And it was not indeed 'doubt' of you—oh no—that made
    me write as I did write; it was rather because I felt you to be surely
    noblest, ... and therefore fitly dearest, ... that it seemed to me
    detestable and intolerable to leave you on this road where the mud
    must splash up against you, and never cry 'gare.' Yet I was quite
    enough unhappy yesterday, and before yesterday ... I will confess
    to-day, ... to be too gratefully glad to 'let you be' ... to 'let you
    have your way'—you who overcome always! Always, but where you tell me
    not to think of you so and so!—as if I could help thinking of you
    so, and as if I should not take the liberty of persisting to think
    of you just so. 'Let me be'—Let me have my way.' I am unworthy of you
    perhaps in everything except one thing—and that, you cannot guess.
    May God bless you—

Ever I am yours.


    The proof does not come!
