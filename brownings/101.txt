
Thursday.
[Post-mark, September 11, 1845.]


    Will you come on Friday ... to-morrow ... instead of Saturday—will it
    be the same thing? Because I have heard from Mr. Kenyon, who is to be
    in London on Friday evening he says, and therefore may mean to visit
    me on Saturday I imagine. So let it be Friday—if you should not, for
    any reason, prove Monday to be better still.

May God bless you—
Ever yours,
E.B.B.
