
Tuesday Morning.
[Post-mark, July 22, 1845.]


    I will say, with your leave, Thursday (nor attempt to say anything
    else without your leave).


    The temptation of reading the 'Essay' was more than I could bear: and
    a wonderful work it is every way; the other poems and their
    music—wonderful!


    And you go out still—so continue better!


    I cannot write this morning—I should say too much and have to be
    sorry and afraid—let me be safely yours ever, my own dear friend—

R.B.


    I am but too proud of your praise—when will the blame come—at Malta?
