    Dearest, I have been kept in town and just return in time to say why
    you have no note ... to-morrow I will write ... so much there is to
    say on the subject of this letter I find.

Bless you, all beloved—
R.B.


    Oh, do not sleep another night on that horrible error I have led you
    into! The 'Dulwich Gallery'!—!!!—oh, no. Only some pictures to be
    sold at the Greyhound Inn, Dulwich—'the genuine property of a
    gentleman deceased.'
