    This is no letter—love,—I make haste to tell you—to-morrow I will
    write. For here has a friend been calling and consuming my very
    destined time, and every minute seemed the last that was to be; and an
    old, old friend he is, beside—so—you must understand my defection,
    when only this scrap reaches you to-night! Ah, love,—you are my
    unutterable blessing,—I discover you, more of you, day by day,—hour
    by hour, I do think!—I am entirely yours,—one gratitude, all my soul
    becomes when I see you over me as now—God bless my dear, dearest.


    My 'Act Fourth' is done—but too roughly this time! I will tell you—


    One kiss more, dearest!


    Thanks for the Review.
