
Friday Evening.
[Post-mark, June 28, 1845.]


    You are very kind and always—but really that does not seem a good
    reason against your coming to-morrow—so come, if it should not rain.
    If it rains, it concludes for Monday ... or Tuesday; whichever may
    be clear of rain. I was tired on Wednesday by the confounding
    confusion of more voices than usual in this room; but the effect
    passed off, and though Miss Mitford was with me for hours yesterday I
    am not unwell to-day. And pray speak bona verba about the awful
    things which are possible between this now and Wednesday. You continue
    to be better, I do hope? I am forced to the brevity you see, by the
    post on one side, and my friends on the other, who have so long
    overstayed the coming of your note—but it is enough to assure you
    that you will do no harm by coming—only give pleasure.

Ever yours, my dear friend,
E.B.B.
