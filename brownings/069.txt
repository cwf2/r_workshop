    How must I feel, and what can, or could I say even if you let me say
    all? I am most grateful, most happy—most happy, come what will!


    Will you let me try and answer your note to-morrow—before Wednesday
    when I am to see you? I will not hide from you that my head aches now;
    and I have let the hours go by one after one—I am better all the
    same, and will write as I say—'Am I better' you ask!

Yours I am, ever yours my dear friend R.B.
