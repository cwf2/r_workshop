
Tuesday,
[Post-mark, October 15, 1845.]


    Will this note reach you at the 'fatal hour' ... or sooner? At any
    rate it is forced to ask you to take Thursday for Wednesday, inasmuch
    as Mr. Kenyon in his exceeding kindness has put off his journey just
    for me, he says, because he saw me depressed about the decision, and
    wished to come and see me again to-morrow and talk the spirits up, I
    suppose. It is all so kind and good, that I cannot find a voice to
    grumble about the obligation it brings of writing thus. And then, if
    you suffer from cold and influenza, it will be better for you not to
    come for another day, ... I think that, for comfort. Shall I hear
    how you are to-night, I wonder? Dear Occy 'turned the corner,' the
    physician said, yesterday evening, and, although a little fluctuating
    to-day, remains on the whole considerably better. They were just in
    time to keep the fever from turning to typhus.


    How fast you print your book, for it is to be out on the first of
    November! Why it comes out suddenly like the sun. Mr. Kenyon asked me
    if I had seen anything you were going to print; and when I mentioned
    the second part of the 'Duchess' and described how your perfect
    rhymes, perfectly new, and all clashing together as by natural
    attraction, had put me at once to shame and admiration, he began to
    praise the first part of the same poem (which I had heard him do
    before, by the way) and extolled it as one of your most striking
    productions.


    And so until Thursday! May God bless you—

and as the heart goes, ever yours.


    I am glad for Tennyson, and glad for Keats. It is well to be able to
    be glad about something—is is it not? about something out of
    ourselves. And (in myself) I shall be most glad, if I have a letter
    to-night. Shall I?
