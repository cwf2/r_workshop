
Tuesday Evening.
[Post-mark, December 17, 1845.]


    Henrietta had a note from Mr. Kenyon to the effect that he was 'coming
    to see Ba' to-day if in any way he found it possible. Now he has not
    come—and the inference is that he will come to-morrow—in which case
    you will be convicted of not wishing to be with him perhaps. So ...
    would it not be advisable for you to call at his door for a
    moment—and before you come here? Think of it. You know it would not
    do to vex him—would it?
