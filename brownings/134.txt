
Monday Morning.
[In the same envelope with the preceding letter.]


    This arrived on Saturday night—I just correct it in time for this our
    first post—will it do, the new matter? I can take it to-morrow—when
    I am to see you—if you are able to glance through it by then.


    The 'Inscription,' how does that read?


    There is strange temptation, by the way, in the space they please to
    leave for the presumable 'motto'—'they but remind me of mine own
    conception' ... but one must give no clue, of a silk's breadth, to the
    'Bower,' yet, One day!


    —Which God send you, dearest, and your

R.B.
