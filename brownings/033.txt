    Nay—I must have last word—as all people in the wrong desire to
    have—and then, no more of the subject. You said I had given you
    great pain—so long as I stop that, think anything of me you
    choose or can! But before your former letter came, I saw the
    pre-ordained uselessness of mine. Speaking is to some end, (apart
    from foolish self-relief, which, after all, I can do without)—and
    where there is no end—you see! or, to finish
    characteristically—since the offering to cut off one's right-hand to
    save anybody a headache, is in vile taste, even for our melodramas,
    seeing that it was never yet believed in on the stage or off it,—how
    much worse to really make the ugly chop, and afterwards come
    sheepishly in, one's arm in a black sling, and find that the
    delectable gift had changed aching to nausea! There! And now, 'exit,
    prompt-side, nearest door, Luria'—and enter R.B.—next Wednesday,—as
    boldly as he suspects most people do just after they have been soundly
    frightened!


    I shall be most happy to see you on the day and at the hour you
    mention.

God bless you, my dear friend,
R.B.
