    Ah, sweetest, in spite of our agreement, here is the note that sought
    not to go, but must—because, if there is no speaking of Mrs. Jamesons
    and such like without bringing in your dear name (not dearest name,
    my Ba!) what is the good of not writing it down, now, when I, though
    possessed with the love of it no more than usual, yet may speak, and
    to a hearer? And I have to thank you with all my heart for the good
    news of the increasing strength and less need for the opium—how I do
    thank you, my dearest—and desire to thank God through whose goodness
    it all is! This I could not but say now, to-morrow I will write at
    length, having been working a little this morning, with whatever
    effect. So now I will go out and see your elm-trees and gate, and
    think the thoughts over again, and coming home I shall perhaps find a
    letter.

Dearest, dearest—my perfect blessing you are!
May God continue his care for us. R.
